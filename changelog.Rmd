## v2.0.8
**2025-11-18**

**Added: Export time-series data feature.**  
**Enhanced: Differences bars coloring rules.**  
- New *“Download plot data (.csv)”* button under the map exports the currently displayed time-series data for δ¹⁸O, δ²H and D-excess.  
- The CSV includes, for each date and variable, the selected station, the nearby mean, the |site − mean| differences, and the active STD×2.  
- Each row is accompanied by the analysis context: nearby search radius (km), isotope-specific thresholds, elevation correction slopes for δ¹⁸O and δ²H, and the active date range (*From* / *To*), ensuring that exported diagnostics are fully traceable to the dashboard settings.


## v2.0.7
**2025-11-14**

**Enhanced:** Elevation correction is now station-centric.
- Altitude reference for the elevation correction was changed from the dataset-wide minimum altitude to the altitude of the currently selected station, making corrected δ¹⁸O and δ²H values directly comparable to the local setting.

**Added: STD×2-based bar colouring.**  
- Difference bars in the δ¹⁸O, δ²H and D-excess time-series are now coloured using both the threshold and the STD×2 metric:  
  - Grey: difference ≤ threshold and STD×2 metric ≤ difference.  
  - Red: difference ≤ threshold but STD×2 metric > difference (potentially suspicious, but still under threshold).  
  - Purple with red outline: difference above the configured threshold.  
- Hover tooltips on difference bars now report both the difference and the STD×2 metric.


## v2.0.6
**2025-09-09**

**Enhanced:** Improved missing-data handling and user experience in the Dashboard:  
- Time-series plots (δ¹⁸O, δ²H) now remain blank instead of failing when data are unavailable for the selected station and date range.  
- D‑excess and XY plots also remain blank when no paired isotope data exist.  
- Introduced a unified warning popup system that displays a single message when one or both isotopes are missing, skips the popup during initial data load, and prevents conflicts with the changelog popup message.


## v2.0.5
**2025-07-16**

**Fixed:** Preview table now shows dates in dd/mm/YYYY format instead of Excel serial numbers.
**Enhanced:** Station Data Availability plot uses the full dataset and offers dynamic hover tooltips (daily: DD/MM/YYYY, monthly: MM/YYYY, yearly: YYYY).


## v2.0.4
**2025-06-20**

**Added:** Interactive map tab with leaflet-based station visualization and customizable radius filtering.


## v2.0.3
**2025-05-10**

**Enhanced:** Data import wizard now fully supports both Excel and CSV inputs with custom delimiters and date‐format parsing.


## v2.0.2
**2025-04-01**

**Improved:** Time-series plots gained threshold‐bar overlays and automated mean‐comparison lines for robust quality checks.


## v2.0.1
**2025-02-15**

**Initial 2.0 release:** Redesigned UI with bslib theming and introduced core isotope validation dashboards and summary metrics.
